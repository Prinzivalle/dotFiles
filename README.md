All files outside folders are from $HOME directory, except for redshift, which goes in $HOME/.config.

Openbox folder has particular structure: config folder must go inside $HOME/.config/openbox, while the menu folder must go inside a folder reachable and specified inside the $HOME/.config/openbox/menu.xml file.

All folders come from $HOME/.config except screenshot, wallpaper and etc.
